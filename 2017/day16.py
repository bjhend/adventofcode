The main problem of this task is the enormous number of repititions required for
part 2. It is not feasible to just repeat a direct solution of part 1 this many
times.

To solve this we remember that repeating the same reorder operation on a finite
list reproduces the initial order after a finite number of operations, which we
call the cycle length. So we can produce an arbitrary number of repetitions by
only executing the operation that number modulo the cycle length times.

By further investigation we find out that spin and exchange moves operate on the
positions of the programs while the partner move operates on the names of the
programs. This makes the two types independent of each other. The spin and exchange
moves are permutations of the order, so we call them permutation moves.

To find an efficient solution we separate permutation and partner moves entirely
and execute all permutation moves before the partner moves and also determine their
cycle lengths for part two independently.
